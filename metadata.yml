Title: DrugBank (11k) Similarity Search
Description: A similarity search model on a DrugBank database with around 11000 compounds.
  Built using FAISS, fingerprints are L2 normalised and added to an Inner Product
  Index (Cosine Similarity). Since the database isn't very large, it is worth having
  this without any compression or approximation.
